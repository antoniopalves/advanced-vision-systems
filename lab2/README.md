# AVS Lab 2 ‚Äì Foreground Moving Object Detection

This repository contains Python implementations of exercises 2.1 to 2.4 from **Laboratory 2** of the *Advanced Vision Systems* course (AGH University of Krakow). These tasks focus on foreground object detection through frame differencing and basic image analysis techniques.

## üìÅ File Overview

| File       | Task Description                                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Ex2.1.py   | Load and display image sequences (e.g., `pedestrians`)  |
| Ex2.2.py   | Perform frame differencing and binarization             |
| Ex2.3.py   | Label connected components and analyze the largest one  |
| Ex2.4.py   | Evaluate detection with precision, recall, and F1 score |

## üì¶ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Ensure the required video/image sequences (input/, groundtruth/, ROI, temporalROI.txt) are in the correct directories as expected by the scripts.

Run a script like this:
