# AVS Lab 1 – Vision Algorithms in Python

This repository contains the implementation of **Laboratory 1** from the *Advanced Vision Systems* course at AGH University of Krakow. The lab introduces basic image processing tasks using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 🧪 Lab Scope

This lab focuses on:

- Reading, displaying, and saving images
- Color space conversion (BGR ↔ Grayscale / HSV)
- Image scaling and rescaling
- Basic arithmetic operations on images
- Histogram computation and equalization
- Image filtering (Gaussian, Sobel, Laplacian, Median)

## 📁 File Overview

| File         | Task Description                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Task1.1.py   | Read and display an image using OpenCV           |
| Task1.2.py   | Read and display an image using Matplotlib       |
| Task1.3.py   | Color space conversion: Grayscale and HSV        |
| Task1.4.py   | Color channel visualization (H, S, V)            |
| Task1.5.py   | Image arithmetic: addition, subtraction, etc.    |
| Task1.6.py   | Histogram computation and equalization (CLAHE)   |
| Task1.7.py   | Image filtering: Gaussian, Sobel, Laplacian, etc.|

> The image used (`mandril.jpg`, `lena.jpg`) should be placed in the same directory.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 and the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Run any task with:

bash
